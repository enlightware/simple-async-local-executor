## Overview

A single-threaded polling-based executor suitable for use in games, embedded systems or WASM.
This executor can be useful when the number of tasks is small or if a small percentage is blocked.
Being polling-based, in the general case it trades off efficiency for simplicity and does not require any concurrency primitives such as `Arc`, etc.

## Usage

To use this crate, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
simple-async-local-executor = "0.1.0"
```

Then, see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/simple-async-local-executor) for more details.
